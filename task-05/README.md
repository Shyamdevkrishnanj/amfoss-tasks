This work was made simpler for me by the fact that I completed a similar debugging task the previous year. Initial adjustments were made on the server before moving to the client. The installation of dotnet was the main issue I had. I had to use a different system to execute my code. But the errors were soon addressed, and the lines that were missing were added.
