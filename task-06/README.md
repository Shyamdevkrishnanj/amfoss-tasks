# Flame Game (Flutter) 
I have tried the flutter project that was one of the AMFOSS Task for 2021, so I assumed it would be simple. The basi were familiar to me. But I found it to be a challenging effort to set up Android Studio. The flutter project in Android Studio has taken me days to set up. Making was simpler because of the availability of reference material.
